# Robo-code
This uses micropython for the ev3 bricks!

# IMPORTANT THINGS
 - See below about the sim
 - Positions of the objects are stored in `dat/positions.json` :)
## Installation
### Must install
`pip install pybricks`

### For the sim
`pip install pygame pyttsx3 simpleaudio`

If running on Ubuntu you also need to FIRST run `sudo apt install libespeak1` and `sudo apt-get install -y libasound2-dev` for the sim to work too

# Simulator
 - Example code (for *my* way of working on the project) is stored in the `examples/` directory, just copy all the files to the main directory to see it work! Also has the simulator in it too!
