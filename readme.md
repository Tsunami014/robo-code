# Robo-code
This uses micropython for the ev3 bricks!

# IMPORTANT THINGS
 - Simulator coming soon! Check back later.
 - Positions of the objects are stored in `dat/positions.json` :)
 - Example code (for *my* way of working on the project) is stored in the `examples/` directory, you do not have to use it! When I finish the simulator, this will be more of use
